# Homework-1031

This project focuses on modernizing an Android application by implementing UI/UX enhancements and code refactoring.

#### Key Updates

* Layout Optimization (Lab2): 
Implemented 16dp padding on the main layout and horizontally centered key components (RadioGroup, Button) for improved user experience.

* View Binding Implementation (Lab3): Replaced findViewById with View Binding to ensure compile-time type and null safety, resulting in much cleaner and more reliable Kotlin code.
